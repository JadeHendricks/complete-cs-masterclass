"Using System"
============================================
What this means that I want to use the namespace call "System" and this namespace has a bunch of diffent class you can use in your file.

Console Methods Explained
============================================
Console.Write("TEXT") - prints and keeps the cursor on the same line. (won't add spacing if you don't tell it too)
Console.WriteLine("TEXT") - prints and keeps the cursor on the next line.
Console.Read() - Takes a single inut of type string and returns the ASCII value of that input.
Console.ReadLine() - Takes a string or Integer input and returns it as the output value. (almost like a prompt that returns a value)
Console.ReadKey() - Takes a single input of the type string and it returns the Key info. (leaves our console open)
